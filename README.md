# Lewis Flude's Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles! These can be used to quickly set up a new development environment. Please feel free to tweak/modify for your own use by making a fork.

Get started by pulling down this repo to your home directory, `cd` into the project and run `./bootstrap.sh` to begin the bootstrapping process.

This will install:

* Brew
* Zsh
* Tmux
* Nvm
* Alacritty

After those are installed symlinks will be added for configs for zsh, vim, tmux and alacritty. You can edit these to your preferences, and they should automatically work!
